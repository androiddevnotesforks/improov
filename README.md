Improov is a app that will help you achieve your goals.

By choosing to add a goal to the app and not keep it lost in thought, you will have an easier time viewing the steps necessary to achieve it.

Created with ❤️ to study topics related to Android such as Kotlin, MVVM, Coroutines, Kotlin Flow, Jetpack (Room, ViewModel, Navigation) and Dagger2.

Warning:
------- 
I know that this project was used as a reference code for some developers and I want to say something about it.

Be careful with this project.

Since the first commit, a lot has changed and learned. This project achieved his goal.

In this classes, methods and lines of code, there are some things that if I had to do today, I will do they differently.

Today I know that there are maintainable and smarter ways to do it.

This is not a note of regret. It's a note to celebrate the power of experience.
